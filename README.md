Conclusion

1. Project Overview
In this case study, we perform essential data cleansing and transformations to prepare for analysis on weekly sales data for Data Mart. The project focuses on refining date formats, categorizing demographics, and calculating meaningful metrics like avg_transaction, which we will use in deeper analysis to answer specific business questions. The goal is to:

Address missing values and ensure data consistency.
Transform segment data to provide meaningful age and demographic insights.
Calculate yearly, monthly, and weekly metrics and analyze changes over time.
2. Data Cleansing and Transformation
We begin by creating a clean, transformed version of the dataset in the data_mart schema with a new table called clean_weekly_sales. Key transformations include:

Date and Calendar Transformations: Converting the week_date field into a date format and creating columns for week_number, month_number, and calendar_year.
Demographic and Age Band Mapping: Assigning each segment to an age band (e.g., Young Adults, Middle-Aged, Retirees) and demographic group (Couples, Families).
Handling Null Values: Replacing all null values with "unknown" in relevant columns.
Additional Metrics: Creating an avg_transaction column as sales / transactions, rounded to two decimal places.

3. Exploratory Analysis
Once the data is cleansed, we dive into a series of exploratory queries to answer specific questions:

Weekday Patterns: Analyzing which days of the week are represented for week_date values.
Missing Week Numbers: Identifying any missing weekly data and understanding its impact.
Annual and Monthly Transactions: Summing up total transactions per year and sales per region and month.
Platform Comparison: Calculating the percentage split of sales between Retail and Shopify by month.
Demographic and Age Band Analysis: Analyzing the contribution of each demographic and age band to Retail sales.

4. Before & After Analysis
This section explores the impact of sustainable packaging changes introduced in mid-2020. The analysis compares sales before and after June 15, 2020 to measure performance across demographics, age groups, platforms, and regions.

Key Metrics:
Sales for 4 and 12 Weeks Before and After the Change: Summing total sales and calculating growth rates.
Historical Comparison with 2018-2019 Data: Observing differences in sales metrics to understand year-over-year changes.

5. Insights and Recommendations
Based on the data analysis, here are some notable insights:

Platform Trends: Retail significantly outperformed Shopify in certain months, possibly due to increased foot traffic or marketing efforts.
Demographic Insights: Families contributed the most to overall sales, with the Retirees age band showing strong engagement on the Retail platform.
Impact of Sustainable Packaging: The introduction of sustainable packaging appears to correlate with an increase in sales, suggesting positive customer response.
Recommendations:

Targeted Campaigns: Focus on Families and Retirees for Retail campaigns, as they show strong engagement in physical stores.
Shopify Optimization: Increase efforts on Shopify to close the performance gap with Retail.
Sustainability Marketing: Highlight sustainable initiatives in promotions, as the positive response from the packaging change indicates customer interest.

7. Conclusion
This case study highlights the importance of data cleansing in achieving reliable insights, especially when analyzing customer segments and sales performance over time. By transforming and enriching the data, we could reveal trends and make data-driven recommendations to enhance Data Mart‚Äôs business strategies.

 A summary of the analyses and insights gathered from Case 5:

1. Day of the Week and Missing Week Numbers
Day of the Week: Each week_date typically represents the start of the week, providing a consistent basis for weekly reporting. This is helpful for analyzing weekly trends.
Missing Week Numbers: Some week numbers are missing in the dataset, indicating that there were no recorded transactions for these weeks. This may require attention when interpreting results as certain weeks are unaccounted for in the data.

2. Total Transactions by Year
Transaction volumes show a steady increase from 2018 to 2020. This suggests a growing customer base for Data Mart or an increase in purchase frequency over the years.

3. Sales by Region and Month
Sales vary by month, indicating seasonal trends, with a noticeable increase during holiday periods.
Regional Sales: Certain regions consistently lead in sales performance, while others lag, providing opportunities for targeted regional strategies.

4. Platform Comparison (Retail vs. Shopify)
Retail vs. Shopify: Retail consistently outperforms Shopify in monthly sales, which may be due to higher in-store traffic or local customer preference for physical shopping. This provides valuable insights for platform-specific marketing strategies.

5. Demographic and Age Band Insights
Demographic Contribution: Families make up a large portion of total sales, with Retirees also showing significant engagement, especially on the Retail platform.
Age Band Performance: Young Adults are less represented, suggesting a potential area for growth through targeted campaigns.

6. Impact of Sustainable Packaging
Following the implementation of sustainable packaging on June 15, 2020, there was an observable increase in sales, suggesting positive customer response. This could encourage further sustainability initiatives in future marketing.

Key Recommendations
Regional Campaigns: Focus on underperforming regions to increase local engagement.
Targeted Marketing for Families and Retirees: Families and Retirees are significant contributors to in-store sales, so targeted campaigns aimed at these groups could enhance sales.
Shopify Optimization: Given the lower performance of Shopify compared to Retail, optimizing Shopify listings and promotions could help bridge the gap.
Highlight Sustainable Practices: Customers reacted positively to sustainable packaging, so emphasizing similar initiatives in future promotions could boost customer loyalty.
These insights and recommendations provide Data Mart with a clearer understanding of customer behavior across platforms and demographics, guiding future strategy for targeted growth.
